# BMI and Calories Calculator
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is widely used to determine whether a person has a healthy weight, is underweight, overweight, or obese. Maintaining a healthy BMI is essential for overall health and well-being. In addition, understanding the number of calories needed per day is crucial for weight management.

The main objective of the program is to help users determine their BMI and the number of calories needed per day to maintain their weight, lose weight, or gain weight. The program should prompt the user to enter their height, weight, and age and then calculate and display the BMI and calorie values based on the user's inputs.
